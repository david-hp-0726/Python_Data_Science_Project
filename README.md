This project aims to study the influence of Covid-19 on mental health. Specifically, we want to answer the following questions.
1. Since the start of Covid-19, has there been an overall increase in the prevalence of mental health?
2. What socioeconomic factors have been correlated with mental health?
3. Which demographics have been the most vulnerable to mental health issues?
